from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("rocket.png") # Just put the local filename in quotes.
img.show() # Send the image to your OS to be displayed as a temporary file
print(img.size) # A tuple. Note: width first THEN height. PIL goes [x, y] with y counting from the top of the frame.
pix = img.load() # Pix is a pixel manipulation object; we can assign pixel values and img will change as we do so.
print(pix[2,5]) # Access the color at a specific location; note [x, y] NOT [row, column].
pix[2,5] = (255, 255, 255) # Set the pixel to white. Note this is called on “pix”, but it modifies “img”.
img.show() # Now, you should see a single white pixel near the upper left corner
img.save("my_image.png") # Save the resulting image. Alter your filename as necessary.
